* CPR
  - Scratch foot to make sure not asleep
  - If you do not have a phone, do 5 sets at 30 compressions / 2 breaths first

  - You are only there to help, not fix the problem
* Notes to self
   1. Do not listen to worries after 9:30PM / when tired
   2. Babies neurons are *slow* so they take much longer to learn than you'd think!
   3. The infant is patently unprepared for life outside the womb and is not doing anything *to you* deliberately
   4. Evolution and natural selection are on your side
   5. Gripping fears *are safe* to ignore (even though it doesn't *feel* that way!)
   6. Beth gets a free pass for the next n months 
   7. Pride and principles are *not helpful* 
   8. No one is watching, and even if they were the people who care about you would not judge you
   9. Don't take things personally
   10. It's ok to not know what you're doing
   11. You will learn to do this better
   12. Accept help
   13. Remember the baby is the priority (can turn people away/down)
   14. Be flexible
   15. Getting carry-out is not a failure
   16. Good is not the enemy of great
   17. Perfection is not an option
   18. You *cannot* control everything
